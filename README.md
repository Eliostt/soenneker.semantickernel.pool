## Features

- **Pool Management**: Efficiently manages multiple instances of Semantic Kernel.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls the rate of requests per entry to optimize performance.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Offers various options to tailor the pool to your needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for seamless integration with .NET applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Soenneker Semantic Kernel Pool, you can clone this repository and follow the installation instructions. If you prefer, you can also check the [Releases](https://github.com/Eliostt/soenneker.semantickernel.pool/releases) section for downloadable files that you can execute.

## Installation

To install the Soenneker Semantic Kernel Pool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eliostt/soenneker.semantickernel.pool.git
   cd soenneker.semantickernel.pool
   ```

2. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. If you prefer, you can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Eliostt/soenneker.semantickernel.pool/releases) section. Just execute the downloaded file to get started.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the Semantic Kernel Pool in your application. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to initialize the pool and make requests:

```csharp
using Soenneker.SemanticKernel.Pool;

var kernelPool = new SemanticKernelPool();
kernelPool.Initialize();

// Make a request
var result = kernelPool.Request("Your input data");
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

### Configuration Options

You can customize the pool with various options. Here are some common configurations:

- **Max Instances**: Set the maximum number of kernel instances in the pool.
- **Rate Limit**: Define the rate limit for requests.
- **Timeout**: Specify a timeout for each request.

Example configuration:

```csharp
var options = new PoolOptions
{
    MaxInstances = 10,
    RateLimit = 5, // 5 requests per second
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)
};

var kernelPool = new SemanticKernelPool(options);
```

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a crucial feature of the Soenneker Semantic Kernel Pool. It helps manage the load on your Semantic Kernel instances by controlling how many requests can be processed at a time. This prevents overloading the instances and ensures consistent performance.

### How It Works

When you make a request to the pool, it checks the current rate of requests against the defined limit. If the limit is reached, the request will be queued until it can be processed.

### Example

Hereâ€™s how you can implement rate limiting in your application:

```csharp
var kernelPool = new SemanticKernelPool(new PoolOptions { RateLimit = 5 });

for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++)
{
    var result = kernelPool.Request($"Input {i}");
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```

In this example, only 5 requests will be processed per second. The rest will wait until the rate limit allows them to proceed.
